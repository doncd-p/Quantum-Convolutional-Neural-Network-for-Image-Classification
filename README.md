# Quantum Convolutional Neural Network (QCNN) for Image Classification

## Overview

This is research project for Quantum Software Fundamentals (COMP90084). In this project, we explore the application of Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNN) to classical image classification tasks. We review the concept of QCNN and its potential advantages over classical Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Our experimentation involves applying various QCNN structures to the Chinese-MNIST dataset and comparing the results with traditional CNN approaches. While QCNN models exhibit slightly lower accuracy, they demonstrate significantly higher stability compared to CNN.

## Introduction

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are widely used in computer vision, natural language processing, and signal analysis. However, the computational demands of CNNs for handling large datasets and complex algorithms can be substantial. Quantum algorithms offer the potential to address these challenges by leveraging quantum properties to solve problems faster. Quantum machine learning, including QCNN, has emerged as an area of active research aiming to enhance classical algorithms' performance.

## Methodology

We experiment with variational quantum circuits based on QCNN applied to the Chinese-MNIST dataset. Different encoding methods and circuit structures are explored to evaluate their impact on classification performance. Additionally, we implement a traditional CNN with comparable parameters for benchmarking purposes.

## Experiments

We conduct experiments to evaluate the performance of QCNN compared to CNN in image classification tasks. The experiments involve training and testing various QCNN models on the Chinese-MNIST dataset using different encoding techniques and circuit architectures.

## Results and Analysis

The results indicate that while QCNN models achieve slightly lower accuracy compared to CNN, they exhibit significantly higher stability, particularly in handling variations in the dataset and training conditions. We analyze the implications of these findings and discuss potential reasons for the observed differences in performance between QCNN and CNN.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, our project demonstrates the feasibility of applying QCNN to classical image classification tasks. While QCNN models may not achieve the same level of accuracy as CNN, they offer enhanced stability and robustness, which are crucial factors in real-world applications. Further research is warranted to explore optimization techniques and potential improvements in QCNN architectures for better performance.

## Future Directions

Future directions for research include exploring optimization strategies for QCNN models to improve their accuracy without sacrificing stability. Additionally, investigating the scalability of QCNN for larger datasets and more complex image classification tasks could provide valuable insights into its practical utility.
